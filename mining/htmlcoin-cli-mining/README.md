## How to run generatetoaddress from command line infinitely
* Current Version: 1.1

#### Supported platform:
  - Linux
  - Ubuntu Mate for Raspberry Pi3

#### Prerequisite:
  - HTMLCoin CLI version is built/installed properly and tested.

#### Setup
  * download `htmlcoin-cli-mining.sh` file.

  * If this file is not executable, run this
    - `chmod +x htmlcoin-cli-mining.sh`

  * open the file with your favorite editor

  * on line 16 `cd HTMLCOIN`
    - if you want to run this script from the root, then find the path to your htmlcoin wallet folder and change to the correct path
      - for example:
        - if your wallet is under username/HTMLCOIN-2.0.0.2, then change the line 16 to
          - `cd HTMLCOIN-2.0.0.2`
    - if you want to run this script inside of the wallet folder, then comment it out like this
      - `# cd HTMLCOIN`

  * on line 22 `src/htmlcoin-cli generatetoaddress 100 YOUR-RECEIVE-ADDRESS 7777777`
    - change `YOUR-RECEIVE-ADDRESS` to your wallet `RECEIVE` address you have created.

  * save the file

#### Run
  - `sudo ./htmlcoin-cli-mining.sh`
    - because of the log file I am creating, you have to run this with `sudo`.  I am going to make non-log file version soon.
  - if you are getting any error, there is a chance that your wallet is not synchronized yet. wait little while until your wallet is fully synchronized.
  - if you are curious about the current wallet status, then run this inside of the wallet folder.
    - `src/htmlcoin-cli getinfo`
    - you will see something like this

      ````.JSON

  - when you run this code, the code will create a new log file, `wallet-mining.log` under the wallet folder.
    - you can monitor the mining status by running the code like this
      - `tail -f wallet-mining.log`
      - hit enter.
      - and you will be able to see like this:

      ```

  - when you see nothing between the brackets, that means you did not mine anything.  If you see seomthing inside like example below, then you have successfully mined the coins!

#### log file
  * Curious on why I use the log file? Because it is now much easier to count.
    - Inside of your HTMLCOIN wallet folder where the `wallet-mining.log` file is, run this command:
      - `grep -R '"0' wallet-mining.log`
        - this command will give you result like this:

          ```
            root@rpi3-ubuntu:/home/rjoo/HTMLCOIN# grep -R '"' wallet-mining.log
              "000000000d0ef812d9045dc679d99c226198ddb498a0f3b6030a23d843e83d93"
              "000000000084885b75f94f51a0b537f41f7ce3e8f8407fa4a1a0d0e878b95e24"
              "0000000025f4dd9846b79faa45582b6ebfb888bb6cd5527ea450147808597231"
              "000000007d2f37d35e3a641fe04e8428a89e4a1c3006e9622031c902d1473ea7"
          ```

        - now, simply count them.  That is how many times your wallet has mined the coins since the beginning of the wallet-mining.log was created.
        - if you don't want to count?  :D then do this.  This will simply return the total findings.
          - `grep -c '"' wallet-mining.log`
        - if you want to remove and do the fresh start, simply delete your `wallet-mining.log` and run the `./htmlcoin-cli-mining.sh` again.
        - if you want to archive the log file instead of deleting it, then do something like this with timestamp at the end.  That way you can archive correctly with timestamp on it.
          - make sure your cli script is not running.
          - `mv wallet-mining.log wallet-mining-archive-2017-12-16-1153am.log`
            - this will rename your `wallet-mining.log` to `wallet-mining-archive-2017-12-16-1153am.log`
            - if you don't want to renam, but simply copy the file, then do this
              - `cp wallet-mining.log wallet-mining-archive-2017-12-16-1153am.log`
              - if you start the cli script again at this point, you will be appending to the existing file.
              - if you want to delete the log file, then do this
                - `rm wallet-mining.log`


#### WARNING
  - this was confirmed bug from Peter that if you put `999999999` for the loop, then you will get an error and it is confirmed bug and Peter will fix this issue.
    - for example:
      - `src/htmlcoin-cli generatetoaddress 100 YOUR-RECEIVE-ADDRESS 999999999`
        - this will throw an error

#### History
  - 2017-12-15 `wallet-mining.log` is used to keep the history of mining.
  - 2017-12-14 file created
